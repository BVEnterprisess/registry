# Release Guide

## Creating a Release

1. **Go to GitHub**: Navigate to https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases
2. **Click "Draft a new release"**
3. **Choose a tag**: Click "Choose a tag" and type a new semantic version that follows the last one available (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
5. **Generate notes**: Click "Generate release notes" to auto-populate the name and description
6. **Publish**: Click "Publish release"

The release workflow will automatically:
- Build binaries for 6 platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows Ã— amd64, arm64)
- Create and push Docker images with `:latest` and `:vX.Y.Z` tags
- Attach all artifacts to the GitHub release
- Generate checksums and signatures

## After Release

- Docker images will be available at `ghcr.io/modelcontextprotocol/registry:latest`
- Binaries can be downloaded from the GitHub release page

## Versioning

We use semantic versioning (SemVer):
- `v1.0.0` - Major release with breaking changes
- `v1.1.0` - Minor release with new features
- `v1.0.1` - Patch release with bug fixes
